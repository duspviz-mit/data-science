    "<a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a> is an increasingly popular high-level programming language. It emphasizes legibility over highly complex structure. Python innately provides simple data structures allowing for easy data manipulation. Python provides a simple approach to object-oriented programming, which in turn allows for intuitive programming, and has resulted in a large user community that has created numerous libraries that extend the basic capacities of the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an \"interpretted\" language. This means that every Python command that is executed is actually translated to lower-level programming languages. Lower-level programming languages are very fast and powerful, but writing programs in these languages can be difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two widely-used versions of Python: Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is newer and addresses many of the idiosyncracies and inconsistencies that characterized Python 2. However! Python 2 is still widely used; this is because while the fundamentals of the two versions are the same, there are some significant (mostly syntactical) differences between the two, which makes Python 3 NOT backwards compatible. (I.e., code written in Python 2 will, in most cases, not run in Python 3). This means that you'll <strong>always</strong> need to double-check which version of Python a given script is written in. In this class, we are using Python 3.\n",

    "Python is a dynamically typed language. A language has dynamic typing when variable types are not predefined like in a compiled language; the type of a value is evaluated when the code is run, based on how you are attempting to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing is one of the factors that has led to Python's popularity. However, Python's Standard Library only provides very basic functionality. In order to extend Python’s functionality, its user community has created a very large number of libraries. A library is a module that can be imported to add functionality. Libraries usually take advantage of Object-Oriented-Programming, defining Python objects in additional scripts that can then be instantiated in our current code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Loading libraries into our current context can be computationally expensive---loading large libraries (or libraries in large numbers) can hog system resources. For that reason, Python requires us to explicitly load the libraries that we want to use:\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import pi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also change the name of the library when it gets imported, making it easier to reference:\n",
