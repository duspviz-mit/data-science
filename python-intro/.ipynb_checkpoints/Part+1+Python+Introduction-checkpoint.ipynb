    "Dynamic typing and a number of other language specific characteristics, like readability and reusability, make it a very popular programming language with a large user community. However, Python on itself only provides a basic number of modules and functionality. In order to extend Python’s functionality, the active community has created a very large number of libraries. A library is a built-in or external module that can be imported into our current code to add functionality. Libraries usually take advantage of Object-Oriented-Programming, defining Python objects in additional scripts that can then be instantiated in our current code. \n",

The different states are executed based on a number of rules. We can control the flow of the program through a number of structures. In python there are three main categories of program control flow:\n",
